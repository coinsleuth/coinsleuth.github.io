            <h2>The Blog</h2>
			<p>
                This is a website/blog used to post all manner of musings and thoughts about
                the crypto currency space.  The slant for most of the postings will be of a
                technical nature, however, philosophical rants will also be prominent
            </p>
            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p>
                I am a software developer from South Africa who first got exposed to the internet
                in the early 90s - I actual made a brochure website for the original httpd and
                netscape combination.  I have written CGI scripts in perl and C, ASPX in VB and
                been through the ringer and back.  I love technology.  I love IT and I love
                solving software puzzles.  It is this same love that has led me to look into
                the Cryptocurrency area - to be honest the price volatility really doesn't
                bother me as I am more interested in the issues related to utility and
                scalability; if these are taken care of the price will take care of itself.
            </p>
            <p>Come with me and enjoy the ride.</p>
