excerpt: The original ICO and smart contract platform.

Ethereum is the original decentralised smart contract platform, presented in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalic Buterin. In the white paper, Vitalik Buterin describes Bitcoin - which was and still is the pre-eminent cryptocurrency - as a specialised state machine, with transactions representing state transitions (This is still my favourite analysis of Bitcoin and the blockchain).  In computer science parlance, a state machine is a machine (or computer program) that exists in any of a set of defined states.  Changes in state or state transitions happen in response to stimuli - internal or external, with it being impossible for the machine to be in more than one state at a time.  
A good example of a state machine is an elevator in a building, in which the individual floors represent the possible states.  An elevator moves to a state based on requests (external stimuli) from users who want to move between floors in the building. Taking the same concepts, Vitalik views the ownership of all Bitcoins in the network as the current state of the network, and bitcoin transactions as the stimuli that lead to a change in state.  The strong point of this analysis is that, by viewing the Bitcoin network in this manner, Vitalik is able to strip the network to it’s bare essentials and think of it as a network representing the ownership of value, rather than as a form of money - money is just another form of value.  Furthermore, by observing from this angle, he was able to posit that if money is not the only value being managed on the blockchain, then it is possible that the different values would react to stimuli in different ways.  Vitalic further showed that although the Bitcoin network had limited scripting ability, there were a few shortcomings with regards to meeting this need, namely:
1. The scripting language is not Turing complete
2. The scripting language is blind to values on the network
3. Bitcoin transactions can be either spent or unspent, removing any possibility for flexible interaction states.
4. Unspent transactions, which are the scope in which the scripts run, have static values and cannot make variable transfers of value.

Ethereum, described by Vitalik as ‘a blockchain with a built-in Turing complete programming language’, eliminates all of these shortcomings, by building a Turing complete programmable framework.  The flexibility of the Ethereum blockchain allows developers to create customised ‘arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions’.
